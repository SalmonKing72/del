<h1>Developers Guide</h1>

<p>
    This page exists to help developers get started using the data in the DEL through the FHIR server.
</p>

<h1>Questionnaire</h1>

<p>
    Questionnaires store the entire structure and hierarchy of a standard form. A questionnaire is useful if you wish to
    recreate the paper form that the questionnaire represents.
</p>

<p>
    Each questionnaire resource represents a single standard form and version. For example, IRF-PAI 3.0 and IRF-PAI 2.0
    are separate resources.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Profile:</b> https://impact-fhir.mitre.org/r4/StructureDefinition/del-StandardForm
</p>

<p>To retrieve all the standard forms, query for questionnaires matching the profile:</p>

<pre>GET https://&lt;fhir-server&gt;/Questionnaire?_profile=https://impact-fhir.mitre.org/r4/StructureDefinition/del-StandardForm</pre>

<p>To retrieve a single standard form, simply get the questionnaire by ID:</p>

<pre>GET https://&lt;fhir-server&gt;/Questionnaire/IRF-PAI-3.0</pre>

<h1>Library</h1>

<p>
    The questionnaire resource is great for storing the entire structure of a standard form, but a questionnaire is not
    very searchable according to the FHIR specification. It's difficult to find a questionnaire based on what questions
    are contained within it, and difficult to find a question.
</p>

<p>
    For that reason, we have duplicated the definition of standard forms as library resources, which is a more
    searchable resource.
</p>

<p>
    Each library resource represents a single standard form and version. For example, IRF-PAI 3.0 and IRF-PAI 2.0
    are separate resources.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Profile:</b> https://impact-fhir.mitre.org/r4/StructureDefinition/del-StandardFormLibrary
</p>

<p>To retrieve all the standard forms, query for libraries matching the profile:</p>

<pre>GET https://&lt;fhir-server&gt;/Library?_profile=https://impact-fhir.mitre.org/r4/StructureDefinition/del-StandardFormLibrary</pre>

<p>You may also search by any other field defined as searchable on the library resource:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/library.html#search">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/library.html#search</a></p>

<h1>Measure</h1>

<p>
    As mentioned in the Library section, a questionnaire is not very searchable. It's difficult to find specific
    questions and difficult to figure out what questions are reused across standard forms.
</p>

<p>
    We have duplicated the definition of standard form questions (also known as items) as measures resources, which is a
    more searchable resource.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Profile:</b> https://impact-fhir.mitre.org/r4/StructureDefinition/del-StandardFormQuestion
</p>

<p>To retrieve all the standard form questions, query for measures matching the profile:</p>

<pre>GET https://&lt;fhir-server&gt;/Measure?_profile=https://impact-fhir.mitre.org/r4/StructureDefinition/del-StandardFormQuestion</pre>

<p>To find all questions that contain a specific term (like "influenza"), query for measures matching the profile and
    where the title contains the term:
</p>

<pre>GET https://&lt;fhir-server&gt;/Measure?_profile=https://impact-fhir.mitre.org/r4/StructureDefinition/del-StandardFormQuestion&amp;title:contains=influenza</pre>

<p>
    Measures link back to library resources so that you can see which libraries/standard forms use a specific question.
    Each measure will have a list of libraries like the following. Using the ID, you can retrieve details about the
    associated measure or questionnaire object.
</p>

<pre>
"library": [
    "Library/Questionnaire-OASIS-C1-012015",
    "Library/Questionnaire-OASIS-C1-102015",
    "Library/Questionnaire-OASIS-C2-012017",
    "Library/Questionnaire-OASIS-D-012019",
    "Library/Questionnaire-OASIS-D1-012020"
]
</pre>

<p>
    Using the <code>_include</code> parameter, you may also instruct the FHIR server to include the associated library
    resources in the returned bundle. This removes the need to query for the associated libraries manually if you know
    you will need them in the same response:
</p>

<pre>GET https://&lt;fhir-server&gt;/Measure?_profile=https://impact-fhir.mitre.org/r4/StructureDefinition/del-StandardFormQuestion&amp;_include=*</pre>

<p>You may also search by any other field defined as searchable on the measure resource:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/measure.html#search">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/measure.html#search</a></p>
