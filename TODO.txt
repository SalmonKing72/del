Make sure library is working properly with all fields.
Make sure measure migrator is working properly with all fields.
Add mapping from measure back to libraries.
Add response options to measures.
Document field mapping in IG.



Exclude answerOption with code of "Text" or "ICD".
Change type to "open-choice" if at least one answerOption.




Leave these alone (for now) and change question type to open-choice.
Client must figure out minimum and maximum value by presence of these options.
{
    "valueCoding": {
    "code": "00",
    "display": "Minimum value"
    }
},
{
    "valueCoding": {
    "code": "99",
    "display": "Maximum value"
    }
}



For things like {patient/resident}, how do we determine which one to display?
Also things like {admission} which in OASIS would be SOC/ROC


Record most recent height measure since SOC/ROC


Can we validate ICD codes? Check if this works:
"answerValueSet": {
    "reference": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/icd-10"
},



Date fields become open-choice.
Client must determine if it's a date field by presence of MMDDYYYY choice.

if question type is "text" then display a text input (with maxLength)

if question type is "integer" then display a number input (with maxLength)

if question type is "choice" then display a dropdown and restrict options to those in answerOption

if question type is "open-choice" then display a dropdown and allow free-text values (with maxLength)

special cases for "open-choice". in all these cases, remove the mentioned answerOption from the
list of available choices

    if there is an answerOption with code of "YYYY" then
    this is a date field and should allow picking a year

    if there is an answerOption with code of "MMYYYY" then
    this is a date field and should allow picking a month and year

    if there is an answerOption with code of "DDMMYYYY" then
    this is a date field and should allow picking a day, month, and year

    if there is an answerOption with display of "Maximum value" then
    this is an integer field and the code is the maximum value

    if there is an answerOption with display of "Minumum value" then
    this is an integer field and the code is the minumum value
