Make sure library is working properly with all fields.
Make sure measure migrator is working properly with all fields.
Add mapping from measure back to libraries.
Add response options to measures.
Document field mapping in IG.



Exclude answerOption with code of "Text" or "ICD".
Change type to "open-choice" if at least one answerOption.




Leave these alone (for now) and change question type to open-choice.
Client must figure out minimum and maximum value by presence of these options.
{
    "valueCoding": {
    "code": "00",
    "display": "Minimum value"
    }
},
{
    "valueCoding": {
    "code": "99",
    "display": "Maximum value"
    }
}



For things like {patient/resident}, how do we determine which one to display?
Also things like {admission} which in OASIS would be SOC/ROC


Record most recent height measure since SOC/ROC


Can we validate ICD codes? Check if this works:
"answerValueSet": {
    "reference": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/icd-10"
},



Date fields become open-choice.
Client must determine if it's a date field by presence of MMDDYYYY choice.
